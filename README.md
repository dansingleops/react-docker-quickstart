# react-docker-quickstart
Docker setup to quickly initialize a React environment
## Build
```docker-compose build```

## Run
```docker-compose up```

The first run will initialize a new app in the `project` directory this will take a while.
Subsequent runs will be quicker and just start the existing environment in `project`

Connect to http://localhost:3001 once the app has initialized
